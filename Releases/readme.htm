                        <br />
			This little application scans files in any two folders, generates data in an Access MDB database (which includes their hash) and allows you to compare these two folders using SQL queries. You can also use this utility without having knowledge about SQL.
			</p>
                    <p>
		It comes with pre-defined SQL queries that you might use most often but code is easily extensible to provide UI to add more queries. You can also open generated MDB files directly and fire any SQL you had like.
			</p>
			<p> 
The target for this utility is complex situations when you have to deal with whole bunch of files replicated on whole bunch of devices over many years, some of this could have been renamed or moved to other folders or had been updated and so on. The ability to use SQL against snapshot of file system to figure out differences is the major design goal. To accomodate with situations where files would have been renamed or date time stamps would be changed even though content remained the same we use hash.
